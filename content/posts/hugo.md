# Hugo Introduction

## Overview

Hugo is a **static site generator** written in **Go**, optimized for speed and designed for flexibility. With its advanced templating system and fast asset pipelines, Hugo renders a complete site in seconds, often less.

Due to its flexible framework, multilingual support, and powerful taxonomy system, Hugo is widely used to create:

- Corporate, government, nonprofit, education, news, event, and project sites
- Documentation sites
- Image portfolios
- Landing pages
- Business, professional, and personal blogs
- Resumes and CVs

Hugo's fast asset pipelines include:

- Image processing – Convert, resize, crop, rotate, adjust colors, apply filters, overlay text and images, and extract EXIF data
- JavaScript bundling – Transpile TypeScript and JSX to JavaScript, bundle, tree shake, minify, create source maps, and perform SRI hashing.
- Sass processing – Transpile Sass to CSS, bundle, tree shake, minify, create source maps, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with PostCSS
- Tailwind CSS processing – Compile Tailwind CSS utility classes into standard CSS, bundle, tree shake, optimize, minify, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with PostCSS
