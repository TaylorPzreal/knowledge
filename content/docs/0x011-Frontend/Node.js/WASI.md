## 一、Introduction
**WASI (WebAssembly System Interface)** is a standardized interface for calling operating system-level APIs from WebAssembly modules. It aims to provide a portable and secure way for WebAssembly applications to interact with the underlying system, enabling them to run on various platforms, including web browsers, servers, and embedded devices.

**Key features and benefits of WASI:**
- **Portability:** WASI provides a consistent interface across different platforms, allowing WebAssembly modules to run without modifications.
- **Security:** WASI is designed with security in mind, limiting the access of WebAssembly modules to system resources and preventing unauthorized actions.
- **Efficiency:** WASI leverages the performance benefits of WebAssembly, enabling efficient execution of applications.
- **Standardization:** WASI is being standardized by the WASI Subgroup of the Bytecode Alliance, ensuring a common and consistent API for developers.
