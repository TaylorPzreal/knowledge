## 一、Introduction
Polyfills are pieces of code that provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. They act as a fallback, enabling developers to use new JavaScript features on older browsers that do not support them or even on modern browsers that have yet to implement those new JavaScript features. This tact ensures that web applications work across different browser versions.
