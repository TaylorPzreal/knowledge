## 一、Introduction
> JavaScript was invented by **Brendan Eich** in **1995**, and became an ECMA standard(**ECMA-262**) in 1997. ECMA-262 is the name of the standard, it represents the scripting language specification **ECMAScript**.

> In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language.
> 
> ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.

JavaScript was initially created by **Brendan Eich** of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape **in 1995**. It has a bizarre history of naming; initially, it was named Mocha by the creator, which was later renamed LiveScript. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.

### ECMAScript vs JavaScript
#### JavaScript
A general purpose **scripting language** that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.

#### ECMAScript
The **specification** defined in ECMA-262 for creating a general purpose scripting language.


## Versions
ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.
Since 2016, versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020).
