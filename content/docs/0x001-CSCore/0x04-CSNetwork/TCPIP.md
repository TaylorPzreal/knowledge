> [!Summary]
> TCP/IP originated in the 1970s when two Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) scientists, Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn, created it. It was initially the standard protocol for the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) and is sometimes referred to as the internet protocol suite. ARPANET is the predecessor of the internet.

## 一、Introduction
TCP/IP stands for transmission control protocol/internet protocol. It's an internet protocol that allows computers to communicate with one another and transfer data across long distances. The protocol breaks data down into little packets and transmits them to its destination. Once it arrives, it puts them back together into one clear message. 

Technically, TCP and IP are two different protocols, but they both have important roles. TCP organizes and sorts all of the data, while IP is responsible for sending and receiving it. IP can work with other protocols, but TCP must always have IP to work. In order to work, TCP/IP goes through a four-layer process twice.
