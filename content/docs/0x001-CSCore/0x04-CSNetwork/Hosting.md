### What is Shared Hosting?

In simple terms, Shared Hosting is a description used when many customers' sites share the same server resources. For Business sites, we recommend your own server so that you have an isolated environment for added protection of your site.

Shared hosting is generally where most sites start out unless it's known from the beginning that an application needs a lot of resources or is expecting a large amount of traffic/popularity.


## Expose local server
[localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) 
localtunnel exposes your localhost to the world for easy testing and sharing! No need to mess with DNS or deploy just to have others test out your changes.

Great for working with browser testing tools like browserling or external api callback services like twilio which require a public url for callbacks.


[Pinggy](https://pinggy.io/)
Public URLs for Localhost. Without downloading any binary!
Create HTTP, TCP or TLS tunnels to your Mac/PC.  
Even if it is sitting behind firewalls and NATs.
